This project was initially me simply following the tutorial for the cube. So much of the base of the code is based off that tutorial. I choose to follow that tutorial so I could figure out the basics and then just play around with it afterwards. The plan of this project at this point was to load in a model of an X wing and I found the model for it and a tie fighter. I even found a death star. I was going to make it so you could fly around in your X wing amongst a sky filled with tie fighters and the death star. I was unfortunately unable to figure out how to open GLTF files. I found tutorials online that said I needed to import the GLTF library which I tried to do yet I kept running into different errors and unfortunately was forced to scrap it. So instead I ended up having to settle with a basic Torus and the box from the tutorial. So you get a nice flying green box simulator. I programmed WASD to move the object without touching the camera. The arrow keys allow for you to move the object with the camera. As I was running out of keys and wanted to test some other features the the i key zooms the camera in towards the object and the o key moves out. The u key moves up and the y key moves down. I was also going to try to add the ability to move the camera with the mouse but I ran out of time because of all the time I spent trying to get the 3d models to load. I also added a galaxy image as a plane on the background.
